## Getting Started

### 1. First Steps
Start with the **Home Screen** to get familiar with the app navigation.

### 2. Add Athletes
Navigate to **Team Builder** to add athletes:
- Use the form to add individual athletes
- Or toggle CSV Import for bulk addition
- Assign tiers (High/Med/Low) based on skill level

### 3. Generate Event Sequence
Go to **Race Roulette** to create your competition:
- Set total events and relay count
- Generate sequence with relay constraints
- Use the reveal system during the competition

### 4. Create Teams
Visit **Assign Teams** to organize athletes:
- Choose number of teams
- Generate balanced teams automatically
- Review tier distribution

### 5. Track Scoring
Use **Scoreboard** to manage results:
- Enter placements for completed events
- View real-time team rankings
- Monitor competition progress

## Data Persistence

The app uses AsyncStorage to save:
- Athlete information
- Team assignments
- Event sequences and progress
- Competition results

Data persists between app sessions but is stored locally on your device.

## CSV Import Format

For bulk athlete import, use this CSV format:
```csv
name,tier,bestEvents
John Smith,High,100m,200m
Jane Doe,Med,400m
Bob Wilson,Low,800m,1 Mile
```

## Scoring System

Default point allocation:
- 1st Place: 10 points
- 2nd Place: 8 points
- 3rd Place: 6 points
- 4th Place: 4 points
- 5th Place: 2 points
- 6th Place: 1 point

## Testing the App

### Recommended Testing Order:
1. **Home Screen** - Verify navigation works
2. **Team Builder** - Add a few test athletes
3. **Race Roulette** - Generate a simple event sequence
4. **Assign Teams** - Create 2-3 teams
5. **Scoreboard** - Enter some test results
6. **Settings** - Check data statistics

### Sample Test Data:
- Add 6-8 athletes with mixed tiers
- Generate 5 events with 1 relay
- Create 2-3 teams
- Enter results for 2-3 events

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **App won't start**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Navigation errors**: Check that Expo Go is up to date
- **Data not saving**: Verify AsyncStorage permissions
- **CSV import fails**: Check CSV format and required columns

### Development Tips:
- Use Expo DevTools for debugging
- Check console logs for error messages
- Clear app data if experiencing persistent issues
- Restart Expo server if changes aren't reflecting
